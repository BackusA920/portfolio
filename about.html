                    <h2>Hi, I'm April Backus</h2>
                    <p>Hey there! I’m a lifelong explorer of all things creative, currently charting my course through the world of coding, and loving the wild ride. What began as a “why not try this?” moment has turned into a full-blown passion for turning ideas into interactive, functional things. Before code stole my heart (and my sleep), I was busy with photography, graphic design, t-shirt making, painting, and tackling any DIY project brave enough to cross my path. Basically, if it involves building or designing something from scratch, I’m probably already elbow-deep in it.</p>
                    <p>I’m drawn to the puzzle-solving side of development, and I get way too excited when things finally “just work.” I’m here to create, collaborate, and keep growing, whether it’s through clean code, bold design, or whatever creative adventure comes next. Thanks for stopping by my little corner of the internet<p>
