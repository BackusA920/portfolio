        <h3>Learning the Basics</h3>
        <p>When I first started tending my code garden, one of the first things I learned was how to plant tidy little paragraphs and sprinkle in line breaks wherever they were needed to help everything grow neat and readable!</p>

      <article class="project-card" tabindex="0">
        <img src="assets/cat.png" alt="Image of a cat for image sourcing project" loading="lazy" />
        <h3>Practicing image sourcing</h3>
        <p>I‚Äôve been growing consistency in my code garden by planting a solid boilerplate foundation, then adding images like cute little animals and giving each one a helpful little alt tag to describe its bloom!</p>

      <article class="project-card" tabindex="0">
        <img src="assets/ListCat.png" alt="Screenshot of list and image source project" loading="lazy" />
        <h3>Using Lists + img src</h3>
        <p>In this project, I‚Äôve been digging into all the skills I‚Äôve grown so far‚Äîlinking websites like vines, planting paragraphs and boilerplates as the roots, adding image sources like blooming flowers, and arranging lists like tidy garden rows. It‚Äôs all coming together to grow one beautiful patch in my coding garden!</p>

      <article class="project-card" tabindex="0">
        <img src="assets/spicysoup.png" alt="Screenshot of spicy soup recipe project" loading="lazy" />
        <h3>Putting all the basics together</h3>
        <p>I brought together all the skills I‚Äôve grown so far to create a special little plot for my own original recipe. Just like the soup, the page is spicy‚Äîwith flavor and flair‚Äîshowing off how much my coding roots have stretched and my skills have blossomed! üå∂</p>
